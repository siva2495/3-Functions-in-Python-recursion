Recursion Function
Recursion Function:
•	Reduce unnecessary calling of function.
•	Reduce length of code.
•	Iteration can be complex sometimes, when we have several possible random cases.
Advantages:
•	Reduce length of code.
•	Iterations can be complex sometimes, when we have several possible random cases.
Dis-advantages:
•	It uses more memory.
•	Time complexity increases, can be slow if not implemented correctly.
Looping Constructs (Iterative Solution) vs Recursive Solution?
•	It depends upon the task.
•	For most common programming tasks go for iterative solution.
•	For particular tasks a recursive solution is both intuitive/simple to understand and faster in terms of execution.
